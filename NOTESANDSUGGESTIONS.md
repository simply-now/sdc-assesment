# Notes and a few Suggestions

## Extra things added to core code

- Added node_modules to gitignore to prevent commits from being overwhelming
- to get things working I tested multiple versions of node with NVM and updated package.json with updated systems this unfortunately took about 1 hour and 20 minutes
  - Some of the older code doesn't work with current node.js and also had depreciated builders and loaders. Happy to explain that info if needed.
  - I assume it's fine to not count that towards the two hours for the assessment as I wasn't able to run the starting code.
  - As of know the package.json works with node lts (v16.17.1) via NVM I'll provide more info if needed, but running npm i and then npm run dev should work

## Problems to leave in and/or fix
Unless the assessment is also testing fixing setups and diagnosing problems here's a few I ran into

## Changes or things I do if I could ask/change restrictions
